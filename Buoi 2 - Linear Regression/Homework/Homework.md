### DEADLINE: 8pm Sunday, June 30th 2019

## Exercise 1:
Implement Multivariable Linear Regression and use it with the following datasets to predict sales value (units) based on TV, radio, and  newspaper advertising spend.

with MSE Loss Function:

And partial derivatives formula describing the slope of the cost function for each weight:

And don’t forget to draw a learning graph like this:

You are allowed to use  `Numpy`, `Pandas` and `Matplotlib`. Just no `sklearn`

## Exercise 2:
Join the [Boston Housing Price Prediction on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). Create your comprehensive solution from data exploration, features engineering, algorithms selection to  training and evaluation (on Kaggle).
Feels free to use any public library, tutorial, explanation or solution that’s you can find as long as you can explain it to others. Don’t worry since this is a very popular datasets with many support material associated to it.
If you are not really comfortable with the whole ML pipeline yet, consider finish [this exercise](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/boston_housing) first. It will help you a lot before competing on Kaggle ;)

### Time to apply something with real world data. Good luck ;)
